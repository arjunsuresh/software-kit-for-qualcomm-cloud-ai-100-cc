********************************************************************************
Simple IO Example
********************************************************************************
This runs on 1 NSP, and only the first thread does any work. The rest print a
message and exit. Inputs are located in L2TCM and VTCM, and output in DDR for
this example.

Thread 0 does the following:
- indicates that it can receive inputs
- waits for the first input, and prints it
- waits for the second input, and prints it
- merges the inputs into the output buffer
- sends that output back to the host
- waits for the host to acknowledge receipt of the output
- prints a message indicating output acknowlegement has been received

Compile:
export QAIC_COMPUTE_INSTALL_DIR=<path_to_qaic_source>/install/<build_type>
export PATH=${QAIC_COMPUTE_INSTALL_DIR}/exec:$PATH
export HEXAGON_TOOLS_DIR=<path to hexagon tools>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${QAIC_COMPUTE_INSTALL_DIR}/dev/cmake/qaic.cmake ..
make

Run (creating the symbolic link because qaic-runner expects the QPC to be named programqpc.bin):
ln -s SimpleIO.qpc programqpc.bin
<path to qaic-runner>/qaic-runner -t . -i ../buffer1.txt -i ../buffer2.txt --write-output-dir output --write-output-num-samples 1 --write-output-start-iter 0 --num-iter 1

See the output:
cat output/outputBuff_0-activation-0-inf-0.bin
